Early Warning System for GLOFs — Jeevan Sethu

This project builds an early warning system for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) and other flood-related disasters. The goal is to provide real-time alerts, evacuation guidance, and access to essential services—even in remote areas with poor connectivity.

Key features include:

Interactive analytics dashboard showing live rainfall, river levels, and alerts

Dynamic evacuation maps with safe, adaptable routes

Nearby medical, food, and shelter services plus volunteer support

Offline functionality through a Progressive Web App for access during network outages

Technologies used: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Python (for AI), MongoDB, Google Maps API, and more.
