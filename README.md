Team Jeevan Sethu | Internal SIH 2025 â€” 3rd Place
##Overview:
Jeevan Sethu is a disaster-tech solution designed to provide early warnings for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) and other flood-prone events. More than an alert app, it acts as a lifelineâ€”delivering real-time alerts, evacuation guidance, and access to essential services, even in remote and disconnected regions.
##Technical Stack:
- Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, Leaflet.js
- Backend: Node.js with Python modules for AI-based prediction
- Database: MongoDB (real-time, scalable)
- Integrations: Google Maps API (geospatial), News APIs (live updates)
##Key Features:
- Analytics Dashboard:
Live rainfall, river status, and alert notifications. Triggers sirens and SOS pop-ups during emergencies.
- Evacuation Map:
Auto-updating safe routes that adapt to roadblocks or construction.
- Services & Volunteer Support:
Displays nearby medical, food, and shelter facilities. Users can request help or register as volunteers.
Unique Selling Points:
- Offline Functionality:
Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to ensure access to evacuation maps, cached alerts, and SOS tools even without internet.
- Human-Centric Design:
Prioritizes usability under stress, accessibility in low-resource settings, and inclusive support.
##Future Roadmap:
- AI-based image processing for rainfall and river monitoring
